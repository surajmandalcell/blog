      <description>Samurai Champloo may have been awesome just like the classics over, but it finished up like Samurai More profound Kyo. Fair normal, nothing extraordinary. There was nothing extraordinary around the appear. The characters were curiously, but not compelling. By the conclusion, I didn&amp;rsquo;t truly care that much around any one of them. The blend of comedy was the one beautiful great portion of the appear. The music was fair awful, no make that appalling.</description>
