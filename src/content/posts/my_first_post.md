Hi there,
I am suraj mandal and this is my blog hosted on github (cause i cant afford anything else rn :p). This is my first post and i intend it to be short as i really dont have anything to say right now.

Anyways this blog took me hell lot of time to make is is a big pain in my buttock as i decided to make a custom theme dedicated to this blog. My blog uses hugo which is a static site generator but its not that easy to use if youre a noob at editing config files and editing variables. Most themes that are found on the hugo site are broken in some aspects so its kind of annoying when some links or tabs don't work as intended.
